file()

What does this mean? Any line ending in the input file will be seen as a '\n'
 |  in Python.  Also, a file so opened gains the attribute 'newlines';
 |  the value for this attribute is one of None (no newline read yet),
 |  '\r', '\n', '\r\n' or a tuple containing all the newline types seen.
